🚢 Titanic Survival Prediction using Explainable Machine Learning

An end-to-end machine learning project predicting Titanic passenger survival using classical ML models and SHAP-based model interpretability. This project demonstrates real-world feature engineering, model comparison, tuning, and explainability techniques.

🧠 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build predictive models that determine whether a Titanic passenger survived based on demographic, socio-economic, and ticket-related features.

This project includes:

Data cleaning & preprocessing

Feature engineering (Title, Family Size, Deck, etc.)

ML model training (LR, Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Hyperparameter tuning

SHAP explainability (global + local)

Performance visualization

📂 Dataset

Source: Kaggle – Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster
https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic

Files used:

train.csv

test.csv (optional for inference)

🏗️ Feature Engineering
Feature	Description
Title	Extracted from passenger name (Mr, Miss, Mrs, Master, Royalty, etc.)
FamilySize	SibSp + Parch + 1
Deck	First letter of Cabin or “Unknown” if missing
IsAlone	Indicator for passengers traveling alone
Age/Fare Imputation	Missing ages & fares filled using median
Categorical Encoding	One-hot encoded categorical columns

These features significantly improved model performance compared to raw dataset.

⚙️ Models Implemented

Logistic Regression

Decision Tree Classifier

Random Forest Classifier

GridSearchCV for hyperparameter tuning

SHAP explainability tools

📊 Model Performance
Model	Accuracy
Logistic Regression	0.8212
Decision Tree	0.8212
Random Forest	0.8324
📌 Interpretation

Logistic Regression and Decision Tree perform equally well at ~82.1%.

Random Forest performs best (83.24%), capturing non-linear relationships and feature interactions.

Shows that feature engineering was effective and improved linear + tree models.

🧠 SHAP Model Explainability

SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) is used to interpret:

Global feature importance (Sex, Pclass, Fare, Title, Family Size, etc.)

Local explanations for individual passengers

How each feature pushes a prediction toward survival or non-survival

Global Importance:
shap.summary_plot(shap_values[1], X_train)

Local Passenger Explanation:
shap.force_plot(
    explainer.expected_value[1],
    shap_values[1][i],
    X_train.iloc[i],
    matplotlib=True
)


SHAP ensures transparency and helps identify bias (e.g., gender or class influence).
